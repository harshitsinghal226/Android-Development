# 📱 Android Development Journey with Flutter & Dart  

Welcome to my **Android Development** repository! 🚀  
This repo documents my learning journey of **Dart programming language** and building Android apps using **Flutter**.  

---

## 🌟 What’s Inside  

### 1. Dart  
- Fundamentals of Dart programming language  
- Practice programs to strengthen core concepts  

### 2. Flutter Projects  
Here are the apps I built while learning Flutter:  

- 🎵 **Audio Player App** – A simple Flutter app to play local audio files.  
- 💱 **Currency Converter** – Converts values between different currencies using real-time logic.  
- 🛒 **Shop App (Flutter)** – A shopping app demonstrating state management and UI building.  
- 🔄 **Swap Skill App** – An app idea focused on skill exchange between users.  
- 🌦️ **Weather App** – Fetches weather data from an API and displays it in a clean UI.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Dart  
- **Framework:** Flutter  
- **Platform:** Android (can be extended to iOS & Web using Flutter’s cross-platform support)

## 📖 Learning Path  
1. Started with **Dart basics** (syntax, OOP concepts, async programming).  
2. Moved on to **Flutter framework** to build real-world apps.  
3. Explored **state management, UI design, API integration, and navigation** in Flutter apps.

## 🚀 How to Run the Apps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/android-development.git
   cd android-development
2. Open the desired project folder (e.g., weather_app).
3. Run the app using Flutter:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   flutter run

## 📌 Future Goals
- Add more Flutter projects (Firebase integration, authentication, animations).
- Improve UI/UX designs.
- Explore publishing apps to the Play Store.
